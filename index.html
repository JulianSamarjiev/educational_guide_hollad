				<p>
					According to the Business Insider, Netherlands is considered to have one of the best educational systems in the world. This fact cannot go unnoticed by the population of other countries. The equational well-being of Holland is attractive so much so that thousands and thousands people from around the world come to Holland every year to benefit from education that Netherlands has to offer. It is a widely established fact that Dutch education and especially higher education account not only for the extensive promotion of the quality education in the Netherlands but also for the strengthening of inter-cultural relationship between the Netherlands and other countries. Given this premise, Education Guide Holland strives to be an intermediary which will successfully implement promotion of the Dutch education across the boards and thus help the Netherlands in general to strengthen intercultural relationship with foreign countries. Educational Guide Holland believes that this goal is more achievable if the potential pupils or students are informed about their preferred educational institution to the best degree possible. The near-perfect awareness of the best sides of studying in the Netherlands is what Educational Guide Holland admires to provide its customers with. In order to make that happen, Educational Guide Holland provides its customers with all necessary services. Among others they are:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Providing them with extensive information about studying, living and working in the Netherlands while being abroad and also when they arrive to NL</li>
					<li>Providing them with extensive information about the educational institution they want to study at</li>
					<li>Helping them with application for the educational institutions </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Nonetheless, abovementioned services are pretty much generic among Dutch companies involved in the promoting education in the Netherlands. What sets Educational Guide Holland apart is that it gives an opportunity for a prospective students to get an immediate experience and a more clear vision of how it is like to study, work and live in the Netherlands. That is why Education Guide Holland sees a great value in bringing potential pupils/students to the Netherlands and guiding them through the schools that they are interested in before they make any decision about which Dutch school they want to be students of.</p>

The client signs that and sends it back electronically to the us. Finally, starting from the day of a trip we meet our client and bring him to his premise. After that we transport him to the educational locations he wants to visit, while providing him with extensive information about educational instution. Depending on the wishes of a customer, we can also arrange regular meal and other tours througout the Netherlnds</p>
				<h3>How much does the whole tour cost?</h3>
				<p>The price of a tours depends on the days that a client wishes to stay in the Netherlands, the institutional premise that he wants to visit and addtional services that he may wish to have. Therefore, the client needs to contact us via e-mail and communicate what kind of trips does he want so that we can establish a specific price for him</p>
